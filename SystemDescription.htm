        <h2>Introduction to SvxReflector</h2>
        <p>SvxReflector is a server that connects a number of Repeaters and Simplex links, using SvxLink software. talk groups can be used to separate the traffic. A talk group can be seen as a specific channel, and a repeater or link can be connected to a talkgroup at a time.</p>
        <p>By default, all traffic is in talk group 0 (Off). All repeaters/links monitor talk group (TG235) and the district talk group it belongs to, e.g., 23450 & 23530 for repeaters in Yorkshire. When traffic arrives on one of these talk groups, it is broadcast directly on the repeater or simplex link.</p>
        <p>The entire system can be monitored here: <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">SvxPortal</a></p>
        <p>Latest information can be found on the Facebook group <strong>Svxlink Amateur Radio Users</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Selection of Talk Group</h2>
        <p>If you want to use a specific talk group, it can be selected by DTMF.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>DTMF Commands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To activate talk group 23450 with DTMF, press: <code>9123450#</code></li>
            <li>The repeater will announce that it is shifting to talk group 23450 when you release the PTT. The next transmission broadcasts over all stations monitoring this talkgroup.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>QSY (Change Frequency)</h2>
        <p>During a QSO on a talkgroup, it is possible to move all active nodes to another talkgroup. Nodes that have had local activity since the talk group was activated are counted as active nodes (i.e., the noise barrier has opened at least once). The QSY function is controlled by DTMF commands.</p>

        <h3>QSY DTMF Commands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>92#</code>  QSY to a temporary talk group automatically selected by the reflector server</li>
            <li><code>92nnn#</code>  QSY to number group <code>nnn</code></li>
            <li><code>93#</code>  Track latest QSY</li>
        </ul>

        <p>QSY to temporary number group is preferably used in such a way that calls are initially made to a wider number group, e.g., 235 for the whole of the UK. When all participants have "called in" on the talkgroup, the QSY command (<code>92#</code>) is used to move all active nodes to the temporary talkgroup. The wider number group will then again be free for calls.</p>
        <p>QSY to a specified talkgroup can be used to add more nodes to an ongoing QSO. Suppose a QSO has been initiated on talkgroup 23450, i.e., YorkshireNet. During the QSO, you want to expand with nodes elsewhere in Yorkshire, i.e., talk group 23530. The command <code>9223530#</code> can then be used for this. All nodes currently active on 23450 will be moved to 23530, and all nodes monitoring 23450 will join the talkgroup.</p>
        <p>A passive node can also be manually made to follow the last QSY with the command <code>93#</code>. This can be useful if you haven't had time to "call in" before another user initiates QSY on another node.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The difference between QSY and local TG selection: The QSY command <code>9223530#</code> moves all active nodes to talkgroup 223530, while <code>9123530#</code> only moves the local node to talkgroup 23530.</p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to disconnect a talk group immediately, without waiting 30 seconds, press <code>910#</code> (TG0). Useful if you choose the wrong number group.</li>
            <li>You cannot activate several talk groups at the same time.</li>
            <li>If you have activated a specific talk group, e.g., TG23453, sound from other talk groups will be blocked until the traffic has stopped on TG23453 and 30 seconds have passed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that SvxReflector is not paired with DMR Brandmeister, but it uses identical names and numbers for talkgroups for potential future expansion.</p>
